# C_App_Greedy

This is a simple greedy algorith to those who like to keep the most amount of changes in their pocket

*Remember this project was made for cs50's Problem Set. So to run this, you are going to need to download cs50.h library to your system,
or feel free to mess with the code in a way it does not need that library, since this is a pretty basic algorithm.*
